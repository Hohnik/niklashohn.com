# These are some ideas to implement

## Ideas
1. Non standard hover animation [hilights](https://raphaelameaume.com/) (text marker style)
2. Text on the website has a appearence [animation](https://soulwire.co.uk/) (fly in like powerpoint, decrypt, etc)
3. Something from [NatureOfCode](https://natureofcode.com) or fractal flames or height lines
4. Beautiful Images (landscape in my area, places)
5. Some [projects](https://100.antfu.me/) for people to explore
6. Increase size of the duck based on if it stands on something or height of the map in the background
7. Dithered background like [this](https://xtcjs.app)

## Projectideas

### Image drawing vector

1. Generate edges of an [image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:644/1*S60hg-pTDfj_MPBY-HkXrA.png)
2. Have a Vector (that draws a continuous line) move in a random direction
with the probability higher flying towards the edges detected in the image
